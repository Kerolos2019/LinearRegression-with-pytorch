# LinearRegression-with-pytorch

hello 


here is Notebook  of a small implementation of linear regression formula using torch library , it includes:


1:"data(prepare and load)"  

here we are splitting data into training , validation and testing    datasets

training data is like course material you are learning fro it , validation data looks like practice exam to see if you know the info you got from course material well or not and testing data is the exam test to see if you are performing well or not      

             

2:"build the model"

3:"fitting the model to the data(training)"

4:"Make prediction and evaluation"

 5:"saving and loading the model"



in this notebook I have implemented the first 2 steps and the next post I will continue the rest
